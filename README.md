# Pangenomes of the Human Oral Microbiome Database

## Problem (Biological and Specific)
**Understanding the underlying microbial diversity has been a fundamental problem in biology.** Microbial populations are genomically diverse and dynamic, intra- and inter-population intreraction and the phisicochemical forces that shape the environment impact the diversity and evolution of microbes. Advances in sequencing technology and reduced cost have enabled access to the genetic content of thousands of genomes, allowing us to ask a seemingly simple question: **How many genes exist within a population, and how much variation occurs within a gene or genomic region?**

Despite this advances, comprehensive analysis of entire genomic collections for a taxon (pangenome) remain rare. Most studies focus on specific genes rather than the entire gene collection. Futhermore, there's a lack of standarization in pangenomic workflows - different tools, datasets, and approahces are often used across studies, making comparisons difficult.

## What This Repository Provides
Here you'll find a **systematic and reproducible workflow** that enables the production of pangenomes. I selected the Human Oral Microbiome Database as a test case since it is the most well defined enviromental database comprising of genomes sequence in-house, from other institutions/companies, and from metagenomic studies. It also classifies genomes into taxonomic units, termed Human Oral Taxon based on evolutionary markers, rather than assigning species names. Finally, this database has been constructed and maintined by experts in the oral field.

I relied in Anvi'o, to generate the analysus and visualization, with pangenomes

Disclosure
The "pangenome" is a biological concept that referes to all the genomic information from all members within a closely related group. Because it's impossible to capture all this information at all given time points (dynamics).

Operational definitions:
Pangenome: All the genes identified within all available members of a Human Microbiome Taxon.



## SA
Pangenom refer to [all] the gene content within members of a closely related genomic group. Pangenomic analysis enables us to identify what is shared and what is unique among members of a population at different genomic scales, such as, regions, genes, amino acids, nucelotides, as well as the organization across genomic units.

The pangenome referes to all the genomic information from all members within a closely related group.
