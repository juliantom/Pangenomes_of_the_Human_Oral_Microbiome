# Pangenomes of the Human Oral Microbiome Database
Microbial populations are genomically dynamic. This dynamism is driven by environment factors and long time evolution. Yet, the impact of these 

These processes are reflected by changes in the genome that impact their fitness to the envirnoment.

Changes in the gene composition, mutations, gene transfer, 

Pangenomes refer to [all] the gene content within members of a closely related genomic group. Pangenomic analysis enables us to identify what is shared and what is unique among members of a population at different genomic scales, such as, regions, genes, amino acids, nucelotides, as well as the organization across genomic units.

Here, we focused on microbial pangenomes,
